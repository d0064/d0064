# Hello, I'm d0064 and this is my profile

I want to learn a lot of programming languages, but I'm mostly focusing on these two:

</div>

I started exploring programming in 2020 with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages were the only one i wanted to learn which was hard because i didnt know alot about programming back then.

I'm particularly interested in learning PHP and Ruby to learn more in web development. While i wanna learn almost everything about programming which is not possible, these two are the only ones ive been focusing on since the start.
